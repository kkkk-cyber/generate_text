# generate_text



## Project Introduction

This project implements a multi-attribute controlled text generation system that can generate personalized text based on the user's identity information such as occupation, hobbies, etc., combined with specific themes and emotions. At the same time, the system can also generate pictures that match the text content to provide more intuitive expression.

2. Generate matching pictures: According to the generated text content, automatically generate matching pictures to provide visual support for the text.

3. User interaction system: Provides a friendly user interface that allows users to easily enter personal information, select themes and emotions, and quickly obtain customized text and pictures.
